# UDPcat

Tired of using netcat to dump your UDP packets?

Want to read some rust code?

Am I out of reasons to use this?

Try UDPcat


## Run it with cargo

```
cargo run -- --help
```



## Build it

```
cargo build --release
# copy it anywhere in your path
cp ./target/release/udpcat /user/local/bin/udpcat

udpcat --help
```
